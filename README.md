# Plant Seedling Classification for Agritech

## Experimentation and Configurations
In this project, 14 different configurations were tested to find the optimal model. Each configuration alters the parameters and architecture of the model to analyze how these changes affect the results. The uploaded files contain all the configurations used and a detailed analysis of how each configuration influenced the final model performance.

## Business Problem
An Agritech firm seeks an automated solution for detecting and classifying plant seedlings in images according to their species. This capability is critical for biodiversity conservation, effective crop monitoring, and early detection of invasive species. By automating the identification process, the ultimate goal is to develop a model that supports sustainable farming practices and environmental monitoring initiatives, enabling timely and precise interventions.

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains a folder named `train`, which includes 12 subfolders. Each subfolder defines a class name and contains multiple images representing that particular class (species).

## Objectives
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: The model will help reduce the manual work and time required to identify seedlings.
- **Efficiency Increase**: The model will improve precision and consistency in classifying different species.
- **Timely Actions**: Prompt interventions in farming or environmental conservation become possible with the automated classification.

## Final Discussion

### Pipeline Strength
- **Decent Training Accuracy**: The model has achieved 81% training accuracy, indicating its ability to learn important patterns from the training data.
- **Reasonable Test Accuracy**: The validation accuracy is 78%, demonstrating the model’s capability to generalize well to unseen examples.
- **Consistent Performance**: The test accuracy of 79% ensures reliable performance across various datasets.

### Limitations of the Pipeline
- **Potential Overfitting Concerns**: Although the training and test accuracies are aligned, there is a potential risk of overfitting. Careful monitoring is needed to maintain the model’s generalization capability as the complexity increases.
- **Data Representation**: Variations in data quality or class distribution could impact the model's ability to generalize effectively across diverse scenarios.

### Implications of the Results
- **Practical Applicability**: The model is capable of effectively classifying seedling plants, offering potential benefits for agricultural automation and research.
- **Reliability in Prediction**: With consistent performance across training, validation, and test datasets, stakeholders can trust the model's predictions for real-world applications.
